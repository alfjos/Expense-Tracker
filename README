I'm making an expense tracker right now because I started to work and I need to know where is all my money going.

I'm not thinking of anything fancy, just a desktop application written en C#. Maybe afterwards I could make something syncronized between the devices I use so I can insert new expenses on the fly.

Mostly I'm doing this as a learning experience.
